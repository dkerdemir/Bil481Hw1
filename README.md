Description of static sortCut method:
	The method accepts three arguments. (int[] numArr, int quantifier, boolean inc)
		numArr is an array of arbitrary integers.
		quantifier is the desired size of the output array.
		inc is a boolean value, for "true" it sorts the array in ascending order.
					for "false" it sorts the array in descending order.

	The method sorts the given array with "selection sort" in desired order, and returns a subarray of the sorted array with the given size.
	The tests cover the basis cases and an exception case.
